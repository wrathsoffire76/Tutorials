?> This is a tutorial on installing custom [Luma3DS splashes](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features#config-menu-options). Make sure you have [CFW](https://3ds.hacks.guide/) installed before attempting.


### Step 1


Go to the [Anemone](https://github.com/astronautlevel2/Anemone3DS/releases) GitHub page and download the `Anemone3DS.cia` file. *

* Note: you can also scan the QR code using FBI on the releases page to install Anemone which will eliminate the need for step 2 and 3.
