#### **How to make themes**

Here is a tutorial on how to make themes (WIP, I am not a professional at this)

### Step 1

Download the [.zip](https://github.com/wrathsoffire76/tutorials/raw/master/download/Theme%20Templates.zip) file which will have all the resourses available for making themes.

### Step 6

Open your photo-editor and copy and edit the template files to your liking. You only need to edit the size to make it compatible with Usagi.

### Step 7

When you are happy with your pictures, save the files and open Usagi.

Go to the flags category and start enabling the flags for the things you would like to change, then go to the colour tab and edit the UI colours to your liking.

### Step 10

Once you have set up your textures and colours, start importing your sounds through the CWAV manager.

### Step 11

To finalize, look over everything and make sure it's all correct, then generate a preview and either import a file texture or take one from the theme and export it.

Obtain a source file for your music. It helps if the files are in `.wav` format (although not required).
